# HeartDiseaseRiskPrediction

The goal of the project is to develop and assess machine learning models for predicting heart disease risk. We employed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to build and evaluate these models using a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhaoyingzhu/heartcsv) dataset.

## Overview

We applied various preprocessing and machine learning techniques to our dataset. After training and testing multiple models, we identified the two most promising ones. To compare their performance, we used box plots, Bland-Altman plots, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

## Findings

Our analysis indicates that the performance of Logistic Regression (LR) is the most promising.
